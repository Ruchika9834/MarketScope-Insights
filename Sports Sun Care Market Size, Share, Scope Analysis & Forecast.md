These specialized products often feature enhanced water resistance and long-lasting protection to meet the unique demands of sports like swimming, surfing, and skiing. The growing trend towards sports-specific sun care reflects an increasing awareness of the need for tailored protection in various sporting environments. As consumers become more informed about the impact of UV exposure, there is a rising demand for advanced formulations that combine high-performance protection with skin care benefits.
